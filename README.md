FlowBack is a **web application** that helps developers, students, and knowledge workers capture their entire working flow across websites, code edits, notes, and commands.  
It organizes everything into a **searchable timeline**, provides **AI-powered summaries**, and lets you **replay your problem-solving sessions** like a movie.
